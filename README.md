## *What I find interesting..*

- It is interesting how I--as an aspiring software engineer and a student taking this course--can learn so much about what effective software development encompasses just by reading about the 'bullshit detection mechanisms' this author outlines for non-technical managers. The article seeks to provide an overview to project managers on how they should frame their conversations, questions, and progress reports with their technical software development teams to 'weed' out ambiguity and generalizations--that tend to stall progress and lead to incomplete, buggy, or undesirable design that fails to meet the expectations of stakeholders. I found the list of phrases (signals of bullshittery) the author references that non-technical managers should watch out for incredibly significant as I often perceive in work environments how the technical chasm between software engineers and their stakeholders can be exploited by the former to feign more accomplishment, understanding, and expertise than is actually there.

- Furthermore, what I found interesting about the author's 'medicine'--so to say--for this problem is that his suggestions are highly analagous to the disciplined process we discussed in lecture and we will employ during this course: Requirements Engineering, such as in how we specifices the importance of setting out user requireemnts. It makes me wonder how much more effectively we may be able to teach good software engineering by framing it from the perspectives of non-technical stakeholders often involved in these projects.
